# Session Notes — 2026-02-21

## Summary

First session focused on planning the learning approach for the ChattyKathys project and starting a JavaScript/TypeScript refresher quiz.

---

## Decisions Made

### Learning Approach
- Decided to **learn by building** rather than doing a full JS/TS course first
- Will do a **quick 1-2 hour JS/TS refresher** via interactive quiz, then jump into building
- Claude will explain concepts in context as they come up during development

### Playlab Console Inspection
- Considered opening Playlab.ai in the browser and poking around the console to learn more about their stack
- Decided **not worth it** — production apps are bundled/minified and largely unreadable. Could feel like reverse-engineering, which isn't a great look for a job application. We already have good info from the job listing.

### Remix vs React Router v7
- Confirmed that **Remix merged into React Router v7** — they are the same thing now
- Playlab says they use "Remix with React" — our React Router v7 setup is directly aligned with that
- Only difference is import paths (`@remix-run/react` vs `react-router`), same concepts underneath

## JavaScript/TypeScript Refresher Quiz Progress

### Question 1 — Variables & Functions
- **Result:** Passed
- Knew that `const greet = (name) => { return \`Hello, ${name}!\` }` outputs `Hello, Taylor!`
- Knew `const` can't be reassigned, `let` can be reassigned
- Didn't remember `var` — told not to worry about it, it's legacy
- **Learned:** `const` prevents reassignment of the binding, but object/array contents can still be mutated (`const user = {}; user.name = "x"` is fine, `user = {}` is not)

### Question 2 — Objects & Destructuring
- **Result:** Didn't know this one — learned it fresh
- **Learned:** Destructuring is a shortcut for pulling values out of objects
  - Long way: `const name = character.name; const color = character.color;`
  - Shortcut: `const { name, color } = character;`
  - Variable names must match property names
  - Can also destructure function parameters: `({ name }) => { ... }`
  - This pattern is everywhere in React Router (e.g., `const { user, messages } = useLoaderData()`)

### Question 3 — Async/Await
- **Result:** Passed — understood the concept
- Knew `async` marks a function as asynchronous
- Knew `await` means "wait for this to come back" — understood it's for network calls, things that take time
- **Learned:**
  - `async/await` is nicer syntax on top of Promises
  - Any `async` function returns a Promise
  - `await` unwraps a Promise into the actual value
  - Can only use `await` inside an `async` function
  - This pattern is everywhere: DB queries, AI API calls, loaders, actions

### Question 4 — Array Methods (.map, .filter, .find)
- **Result:** Passed — correctly identified `.map()` output as `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
- Already knew `.map()` and `.filter()` from Rust
- Hadn't seen `.find()` before
- **Learned:**
  - `.map()` — transform every item, returns new array
  - `.filter()` — keep items that pass a test, returns new array
  - `.find()` — return the FIRST single item that matches (or undefined)
  - `.map()` is especially important in React for rendering lists: `{characters.map((c) => <CharacterCard />)}`

### Question 5 — TypeScript Basics (type annotations)
- **Result:** Passed — recognized them as type declarations
- **Learned:**
  - `: string`, `: number` after parameters are called **type annotations**
  - The `: string` after the parentheses is the **return type**
  - Very similar to Rust syntax (`fn greet(name: &str, age: u32) -> String`)
  - Main TS types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `string[]`, `null`, `undefined`
  - `number` covers both int and float (unlike Rust's i32/u32/f64 etc.)
  - **Interfaces** describe object shapes, like Rust structs: `interface Character { name: string; slug: string; }`
  - Key difference from Rust: TS types are **erased at runtime** — they're purely a dev tool, stripped out before execution
- Also asked a good clarifying question: `const` can define anything (string, number, object, function), not just functions
- Learned there are two ways to define functions: arrow functions (`const greet = () => {}`) and function declarations (`function greet() {}`) — both work, project uses both

### Question 6 — JSX (React Components)
- **Result:** Passed — understood that the component takes in name and color and displays them
- **Key takeaway saved by Taylor:** "The whole mental model for React: components are functions that take data and return UI. Everything else builds on that."
- **Learned:**
  - React components are functions that receive **props** (properties) and return JSX (HTML-like syntax)
  - `<CharacterCard name="Gandalf" color="#8A9BA8" />` passes data into the component
  - Curly braces `{name}` in JSX inject JavaScript values into the HTML
  - The destructured parameter `({ name, color }: { name: string; color: string })` combines destructuring (Q2) with type annotations (Q5)

### Question 7 — Putting It All Together (loader + component pattern)
- **Result:** Passed with help — understood the flow, needed clarification on specific syntax
- Correctly identified:
  - `export` makes things available to other files (compared it to Rust's `pub` and Solidity's import syntax — both great analogies)
  - `async function loader` takes a request, awaits data
  - `requireUser(request)` checks auth
  - The component returns JSX with a welcome message and maps over characters
- **Needed clarification on:**
  - `export default` — means "this is the main export of this file." React Router uses the default export as the page component. Each file can have only one default export.
  - `useLoaderData<typeof loader>()` — the bridge between server-side loader and client-side component. `<typeof loader>` is TypeScript boilerplate for type safety, just copy it.
  - `key={c.slug}` — React needs a unique identifier when rendering lists with `.map()` for efficient DOM updates. Not displayed, just used internally.
- **Key takeaway:** The loader → useLoaderData → render pattern is THE core pattern of the entire app. Every page follows: loader fetches data on server, component renders it in browser.

### Quiz Summary
- **Strong on:** variables, functions, async/await, array methods, type annotations, general code flow
- **Needs practice:** destructuring syntax, JSX, React Router specific patterns (loader/component/export default)
- **Rust knowledge that transferred:** types, async patterns, `.map()`, `.filter()`, strict compiler thinking, `pub`/`export` concept
- **Solidity knowledge that transferred:** import/export syntax is nearly identical

### Likely Interview Format (Best Guess Based on Research)
Since Playlab is a small nonprofit startup, their process is likely less formal than FAANG:
1. **Intro/Culture screen** — mission alignment, why Playlab, background
2. **Technical assessment** — could be live coding OR take-home project (startups often prefer take-home)
3. **System design (light)** — how would you build X, architectural thinking
4. **Team conversation** — with engineers, collaborative fit
- **Expect strong emphasis on:** mission alignment (education + AI), ability to ship full-stack features independently, comfort with AI/LLM APIs
- **Less likely:** LeetCode-style algorithm grinding (small mission-driven nonprofits rarely do this)

### Interview Prep Recommendations
- ChattyKathys IS the prep — demonstrates the exact stack they use
- Be ready to talk about WHY education/AI matters to you (mission-driven org)
- Explore playlab.ai itself — try building something on their platform to understand the user experience
- Be ready to discuss architectural decisions you made in ChattyKathys and why

## Playlab.ai Product Deep Dive (from browsing the actual platform)

### Overall Architecture
Playlab is a **no-code AI app builder for educators**. Educators create chatbot-style AI apps through a guided builder interface, then publish and share them with students or other educators. The platform is essentially a CMS for AI-powered educational tools.

### Main Navigation (logged in)
- **Apps** — "My Apps" dashboard showing all apps you've created, with Edit/Launch buttons, status tags, workspaces, search, and filtering
- **My Activity** — activity tracking
- **Explore** — community library of educator-built apps, filterable by Grade Level (Elementary through Higher Ed) and Subject (Algebra, Arts, Biology, Chemistry, CS, ELA, etc.)
- **Learn** — learning hub / documentation
- **Blog** — blog content

### App Builder (the core product — at `/build/{appId}`)
Three main tabs: **Build**, **Design**, **Activity**

#### Build Tab — the prompt engineering interface
- **Left pane:** Live chat preview showing how the app responds to users. Has a "New session" button, message input with attachments, and "Read aloud" feature on responses
- **Center pane:** Rich text editor (WYSIWYG with paragraph formatting, bold, italic, lists, etc.) with three structured sections:
  - **Background** — who the AI is, its role, its audience
  - **Your Workflow** — step-by-step instructions for how the AI should behave
  - **Guidelines & Guardrails** — behavioral constraints (inclusivity, tone, scope limits)
- **Model selector** (top left): Choose AI model (e.g., "Claude 4 Sonnet") and variability/temperature (e.g., "70% variability")
- **Right sidebar panels:**
  - **References** — upload documents (max 30MB) to ground responses, plus "Agentic Search" (Beta) and "Knowledge Graph" (Beta) for curriculum databases
  - **Memory** — app memory/context persistence
  - **Assistant** — AI assistant for helping build the app
  - **Comments** — collaborative commenting on the app
  - **Settings** — Welcome Message, App Name, App Description, App Interaction Style (e.g., "Chatbot")
  - **Inputs** — "Starter inputs" for enhanced user interaction (short text, long text, dropdowns, file uploads up to 5MB)
  - **Tools** (Beta) — toggleable built-in tools: Chart Generator, Number Line Generator, Right Triangle Diagram, Cylinder Diagram, Scatter Plot, Plot Coordinate Points, Export to Google Drive, Create DOCX Files
- **Publish button** (top right) — publishes the app. Note: "Republish your app to make settings changes active for your users. Testing changes in the Builder does not need republishing."

#### Design Tab — public page editor (at `/design/{appId}`)
- WYSIWYG editor for the app's public-facing landing page
- Shows the app card preview (name, description, Start button)
- Where educators write instructions for users before they start chatting

#### Activity Tab — analytics dashboard (at `/project/{appId}/activity`)
- Lists all user conversations with the app
- Filterable by: Users, Date Range, Conversation Type
- **"Configure Conversation Review"** feature — AI-powered evaluation of whether conversations are meeting the app's goals. Three-step setup: 1) Clarify your app's goal, 2) Define what success looks like, 3) Test how we analyze conversations
- Shows message counts per conversation

### Community / Explore Page (`/explore`)
- Grid of community-created apps, each showing: creator name, app name, description, tags (Featured, Assessment, etc.)
- Left sidebar with Grade Level and Subject filters
- Search bar
- "Submit App To Community" button
- Apps can be **Remixed** (forked/copied and customized) via a "Remix" button

### Authentication
- Email/password login
- **Google OAuth** ("Continue with Google")
- **Clever SSO** ("Continue with Clever") — an EdTech-specific SSO provider used by school districts
- "Remember me" checkbox
- Bilingual support (EN/ES toggle)
- URL pattern: `/login?redirectTo=%2Flogged-in`

### Key Product Observations for ChattyKathys Relevance
